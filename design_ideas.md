## The Brief

The reflective tool is built around 21 questions, with the same three being asked of each of seven areas of church life.

The aim is to prompt reflection, but we also want some kind of reflective output. The process is likely to be the most helpful think for the respondent, but there must still be some viz we can gift to them. 

### Seven Areas of Church Life

* Community
* Discipleship
* Communal Worship
* Sacraments
* Evangelism
* Social Action
* Prayer

Prayer is mostly there to stop people saying "where's prayer?"

### Three Questions

1. What new practises have begun?
2. Which existing practises have continued?
3. Which former practises have stopped? 

## Some ideas

If we want people to reflect, would it be worth doing sentiment analysis in order to visualise?

Not sure you can do meaningful sentiment analysis on an individual paragraph?
