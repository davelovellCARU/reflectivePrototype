## The Brief

The reflective tool is built around 21 questions, with the same three being asked of each of seven areas of church life.

The aim is to prompt reflection, but we also want some kind of reflective output. The process is likely to be the most helpful think for the respondent, but there must still be some viz we can gift to them. 

### Seven Areas of Church Life

* Community
* Discipleship
* Communal Worship
* Sacraments
* Evangelism
* Social Action
* Prayer

Prayer is mostly there to stop people saying "where's prayer?"

### Three Questions

1. What new practises have begun?
2. Which existing practises have continued?
3. Which former practises have stopped? 

## Some ideas

If we want people to reflect, would it be worth doing sentiment analysis in order to visualise?

Not sure you can do meaningful sentiment analysis on an individual paragraph?

What are the questions that are really gonna get a man reflecting?

Perhaps the process should be iterative - describing and then reflecting on description.

### An idea

Points move slowly across the screen 

Coord_polar - points move around a circle. They leave lines which reflect changing emotions (user selected). Points fade away, spawn or persist according to how activities have changed.

### Constraints

It can't take too long, and it can't demand too much work. It has to be interesting. 

### Cuttone, Petersen & Larsen: Four Data Visualisation Heuristics to Facilitate Reflection in Personal Informatics

**Fleck & Fitzpatrick**

Reflection takes time. 

Reflection doesn't always happen naturally - people often need a reason/encouragement to do it.

Is it useful/valid to categorise reflection into layers? (Sumison & Fleet 1996)

#### Description

Simply revisisting events. Not really reflecting on them yet.

Description is level 0, but it is the foundation of all the other levels.

#### Reflective Description

Justification for actions is consider, but alternative perspectives are not.

#### Dialogic Reflection

Alternatives are considered, as are the relationships between descriptions. Generalisable principles are looked for.

#### Transformative Reflection

The reflecter's assumptions are biases are reconsidered. Their perspective is changed

#### Critical Reflection

The wider context is brought into dialogue with the immediate context. Ethcial, socilogical and politico-cultural contexts are considered.
