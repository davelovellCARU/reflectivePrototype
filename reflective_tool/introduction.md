Church Army think that you're one of the leading experts on your own missional context, and we want to help you reflect on how your church has responded to the context it finds itself in.

Over the last few months many of the activities, events, and gatherings that our churches participate in have changed beyond recognition. In the middle of that change, it can be difficult to take the time to sit back and reflect on what has taken place.

To help you to take steps on the reflective journey, Church Army have built this tool. By looking at your ministry and those things that have changed, those that have stayed the same, and those that had ended, we can help you build a picture of those areas of life your church has focused on as it has met the needs of the Coronavirus crisis. It may be that new things have begun as well, and this will help you see which areas of church life have flourished in this unique time. 

We have divided church life into seven broad areas. In no particular order these are:

* Community
* Discipleship
* Communal Worship
* Sacraments
* Evangelism
* Social Action
* Prayer

Activities may fit into more than one category, or you may not be sure where something fits. This tool is here to serve you, so place it where seems best to you. 

What can I use this for?

The visualisation of your data could be useful in a variety of ways. It may:
	
* Help give you a way to think of your response.
* Give you something to reflect on with your PCC.
* Form part of a MAP process.

We would love to hear how else you use this as we move forward.
